  <h2>1. Philosophic Foundations</h2>
  <p>The Entropy-Decay Theory begins not as a mathematical invention, but as a philosophical critique of time, space, and energy as human-centered constructs. It challenges the assumption that time is a fundamental physical dimension, and asks whether entropy — as irreversible decay — is the real driver of physical reality. This section explores the metaphysical motivation behind replacing time (t) with directional decay steps (τ).</p>

  <h2>2. Theoretical Structure</h2>
  <p>This section introduces the core theoretical components of the framework. At its center is the concept that entropy propagates as a triggered internal decay process — not a substance moving through space, but a resonance-based alignment of entropic states. Dimensionality is reinterpreted as 33 independent decay channels, from -1D (failure stillness) to 32D (collapse state). The theory also introduces τ-resonance, memory fields, and the Second Entropy Cascade as critical organizing principles.</p>

  <h2>3. Mathematical Model</h2>
  <p>The mathematical backbone of the theory is a reformation of Tsang’s Equation, integrating both wave and stochastic decay functions as simultaneous entropic operations. This section explores how traditional physics equations are reshaped by eliminating explicit dependence on t (time), and instead express behavior through τ (decay steps) and Ψ (entropy curvature intensity). Dimensional fields (e.g., 12D conductivity, 14D surface resistance) are introduced not as spatial volumes but as entropic constraints.</p>

  <h2>4. Experimental Applications</h2>
  <p>While the theory is conceptual, it opens the door to physical experiments — particularly using naturally entropic materials. Geological substances like India Red marble or red granite may contain trapped entropic memory fields that can be released via τ-resonant triggering. This section outlines early experimental proposals, including devices designed to stimulate second entropy cascades in controlled environments, and detect resonance behavior not explainable by electromagnetic models alone.</p>
