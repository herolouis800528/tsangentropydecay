  <button class="accordion">1. Philosophic Foundations</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Einstein’s general relativity teaches us that time and space are not absolute. They bend and shift depending on motion, mass, and perspective. In a universe of relative frames, only one thing remains constant: the speed of light.</p>
    <p>But if light is the one universal constant, approximately 300,000 kilometers per second, then why do we still measure it using meters and seconds — both of which are human inventions? Doesn't this choice contradict the deeper philosophical implications of relativity itself?</p>
    <p>To explore this, we must revisit the origins of these units.<br>
    <strong>Time</strong>, as we measure it, was derived from the Earth's rotation — long before we understood that Earth orbits the Sun. We once believed the Sun "rose" and "set." <br>
    <strong>Distance</strong> evolved from physical standards — like rods of metal — calibrated by the dimensions of human bodies or landmarks. Yet under varying conditions, these rods contract, expand, and deform. How "universal" is a unit that bends with its environment?</p>
  
    <p>The history of physics is full of elegant frameworks:<br>
    Newton gave us gravity.<br>
    Maxwell gave us the electromagnetic field.<br>
    Einstein gave us relativity.<br>
    But as physics shifted from the macroscopic to the microscopic, our models became increasingly abstract. We now describe matter in terms of invisible entities: atoms, nuclei, electrons, quarks, ions, bosons. Many of these have never been directly observed — only inferred through experimental signatures.</p>

    <p>And still, we rely on mathematics to give us confidence.<br>
      In school, we’re taught that experiments are “successful” if the data forms a clean line or a tidy curve. Deviation is called "noise." A perfect fit is taken as truth.</p>
    <p>But what if this elegance conceals a deeper limitation?</p>
    <p>If light is the constant, and our theories are built atop it, have we truly explained reality? Or have we merely described it — from the perspective of beings moving unimaginably slowly compared to light itself?</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">2. Theoretical Structure</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Unlike the Standard Model, the Entropy-Decay Theory does not describe matter in terms of flowing, twisting, or colliding particles. Instead, we treat each atom as a container of entropy, capable of only two essential actions: <strong>intake</strong> or <strong>release</strong>. This reorients our perspective away from the behavior of individual atoms and toward the system as a whole.</p>
    <p>In classical thermodynamics, entropy is treated as disorder — a chaotic byproduct, often labeled as “noise.” In this framework, however, entropy is not a consequence, but the <strong>origin of all observed phenomena</strong>. Entropy increase is not a result; it is the trigger. The verification of entropy propagation — especially between structural decay steps — becomes the central focus of material physics.</p>
    <p>Thus, in the Entropy-Decay Theory, we are not seeking relationships between space and time. Instead, we study the flow of entropy <strong>between atoms</strong>, <strong>across systems</strong>, and <strong>between celestial bodies</strong>. We do not ask what happened when <em>t = 0</em>, but what marked the first step of entropy increase — when <strong>ꚍ = 1</strong>.</p>
    <p>Under this interpretation, planets like Earth are not simply formed by material accretion, but by <strong>entropy collapse</strong>. The Earth’s curvature gradient acts as an entropic attractor, drawing in surrounding matter. In response to this gradient, we perceive <strong>gravity</strong> and define <strong>mass</strong>.</p>
    <p>This leads to a key conclusion: materials that have trapped more entropy at the atomic level are <strong>heavier</strong> and tend to be found deeper underground. This fits what modern science observes — heavy materials, such as uranium, serve as key sources of nuclear energy. In contrast, <strong>light</strong> behaves as the fastest form of entropy propagation. Though massless, even light is <strong>influenced by local entropic curvature</strong>, which explains its bending near massive bodies.</p>
    <p>From this insight, we developed a <strong>33-dimensional model</strong> — not as a replacement for spatial dimensions, nor in search of mathematical perfection, but to describe the <strong>freedoms of entropy propagation</strong>. This model begins at <strong>-1D</strong>, where materials fail to hold structure and decay begins; passes through <strong>0D</strong>, a state of perfect stillness; and culminates at <strong>32D</strong>, where entropy collapses into a black hole. Each dimension adds a new degree of entropic freedom — describing the system’s readiness for structural decay. With this framework, all physical phenomena — from <strong>phase transitions</strong> to <strong>nuclear chain reactions</strong> — are reinterpreted under the logic of entropy-decay.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">3. Hypothesis</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>As we shift from the Standard Model of particle physics to the Entropy-Decay framework, we propose four core hypotheses that challenge classical assumptions about light, cosmology, material structure, and energy:</p>
    <p><strong>1. Light as Maximum Entropy Propagation</strong><br>
      In the Standard Model, light is treated as a duality: sometimes a particle (photon), sometimes a wave — its nature shifting depending on observation.  
      Under the Entropy-Decay Theory, light is not a duality but the <strong>maximum possible form of entropy propagation</strong>. It is massless not because it lacks substance, but because it carries pure entropy flow. What we interpret as “particle” or “wave” behavior is shaped by <em>experimental boundary conditions</em> and the <em>selectivity of measurement</em> — not by the intrinsic nature of light itself.</p>
    <p><strong>2. The Universe as a Steady State with Correlated Big Bangs</strong><br>
      Instead of a single Big Bang event, we propose that the universe is a <strong>steady-state field</strong> in which multiple galaxy-scale entropic collapses occur. Each localized “Big Bang” is <strong>triggered by entropy gradients</strong> from neighboring systems. Once a galaxy reaches equilibrium, it may emit entropy that induces collapse in adjacent regions — forming a chain of correlated galactic genesis events.<br>
      In this view, the solar system could have formed <strong>only ~4.6 billion years ago</strong>, far more recently than the 13.8 billion years predicted by ΛCDM cosmology. This aligns with entropy-based collapse timing, not with an absolute cosmic age tied to a universal <em>t = 0</em>. Instead, the question becomes: when did <strong>τ = 1</strong> begin for each region?</p>
    <p><strong>3. Carbon as an Entropic Leftover, Not a Creative Base</strong><br>
      Carbon is not the origin of organic matter, but the <strong>residue of entropic equilibrium</strong> under Earth’s specific curvature conditions. What burns to carbon — ash, CO, CO₂ — is not proof that everything is built from carbon, but that carbon is what remains <em>after entropy is extracted</em>.<br>
      In this hypothesis, <strong>burning</strong> is an entropy extraction process, and <strong>carbon is the steady-state product</strong> of that process under Earth’s entropic gradient. If that gradient were different, we might burn into something else. For example, <strong>silica (sand)</strong> may be the leftover entropy phase of a prior Earth — possibly the era of the dinosaurs — explaining why fossilized remains are buried in sand, not ash.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Energy via Resonant Entropy Release — Not Just Burning or Collision</strong><br>
      In conventional physics, energy is extracted through burning (chemical potential) or smashing (kinetic potential). But if matter is a <strong>store of trapped entropy</strong>, then energy can also be released via <strong>resonant triggering</strong>.<br>
      Each material has a decay frequency — much like the <em>Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse</em> or a <em>glass shattering from high pitch</em>. When exposed to a matching external entropy input (e.g., light, voltage), a material can enter a second entropy cascade — releasing stored energy <em>without destruction</em>.<br>
      This explains why silica-based materials emit light when electrically stimulated (e.g., in LEDs) and also why sunlight can <strong>trigger current in silica</strong>: in both cases, the material is not a semiconductor in the traditional sense, but a <strong>resonantly responsive entropy container</strong>.</p>
    <p><em>Together, these four hypotheses define a theory where entropy is not the byproduct of the universe — it is the architecture of it.</em></p>

  <button class="accordion">4. Mathematical Model</button>

    <p><strong>Final Full Unified Equation (Pure Entropic Form)</strong><br>

      <p>This equation expresses the second-order evolution of entropy <strong>S</strong> in relation to decay-based progression <strong>τ</strong>, spatial projection <strong>Ψ</strong>, and stochastic entropic contributions. It unites diverse physical phenomena under a singular irreducible principle: the irreversible, directional transformation of structure through entropy.</p>
      <p>This formulation represents the core proposal of this work and a potential path forward for future reinterpretation of quantum mechanics, gravity, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism through a post-spacetime lens.</p>
