  <button class="accordion">1. Philosophic Foundations</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Einstein’s general relativity teaches us that time and space are not absolute. They bend and shift depending on motion, mass, and perspective. In a universe of relative frames, only one thing remains constant: the speed of light.</p>
    <p>But if light is the one universal constant, approximately 300,000 kilometers per second, then why do we still measure it using meters and seconds — both of which are human inventions? Doesn't this choice contradict the deeper philosophical implications of relativity itself?</p>
    <p>To explore this, we must revisit the origins of these units.<br>
    <strong>Time</strong>, as we measure it, was derived from the Earth's rotation — long before we understood that Earth orbits the Sun. We once believed the Sun "rose" and "set." <br>
    <strong>Distance</strong> evolved from physical standards — like rods of metal — calibrated by the dimensions of human bodies or landmarks. Yet under varying conditions, these rods contract, expand, and deform. How "universal" is a unit that bends with its environment?</p>
  
    <p>The history of physics is full of elegant frameworks:<br>
    Newton gave us gravity.<br>
    Maxwell gave us the electromagnetic field.<br>
    Einstein gave us relativity.<br>
    But as physics shifted from the macroscopic to the microscopic, our models became increasingly abstract. We now describe matter in terms of invisible entities: atoms, nuclei, electrons, quarks, ions, bosons. Many of these have never been directly observed — only inferred through experimental signatures.</p>

    <p>And still, we rely on mathematics to give us confidence.<br>
      In school, we’re taught that experiments are “successful” if the data forms a clean line or a tidy curve. Deviation is called "noise." A perfect fit is taken as truth.</p>
    <p>But what if this elegance conceals a deeper limitation?</p>
    <p>If light is the constant, and our theories are built atop it, have we truly explained reality? Or have we merely described it — from the perspective of beings moving unimaginably slowly compared to light itself?</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">2. Theoretical Structure</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Unlike the Standard Model, the Entropy-Decay Theory does not describe matter in terms of flowing, twisting, or colliding particles. Instead, we treat each atom as a container of entropy, capable of only two essential actions: <strong>intake</strong> or <strong>release</strong>. This reorients our perspective away from the behavior of individual atoms and toward the system as a whole.</p>
    <p>In classical thermodynamics, entropy is treated as disorder — a chaotic byproduct, often labeled as “noise.” In this framework, however, entropy is not a consequence, but the <strong>origin of all observed phenomena</strong>. Entropy increase is not a result; it is the trigger. The verification of entropy propagation — especially between structural decay steps — becomes the central focus of material physics.</p>
    <p>Thus, in the Entropy-Decay Theory, we are not seeking relationships between space and time. Instead, we study the flow of entropy <strong>between atoms</strong>, <strong>across systems</strong>, and <strong>between celestial bodies</strong>. We do not ask what happened when <em>t = 0</em>, but what marked the first step of entropy increase — when <strong>ꚍ = 1</strong>.</p>
    <p>Under this interpretation, planets like Earth are not simply formed by material accretion, but by <strong>entropy collapse</strong>. The Earth’s curvature gradient acts as an entropic attractor, drawing in surrounding matter. In response to this gradient, we perceive <strong>gravity</strong> and define <strong>mass</strong>.</p>
    <p>This leads to a key conclusion: materials that have trapped more entropy at the atomic level are <strong>heavier</strong> and tend to be found deeper underground. This fits what modern science observes — heavy materials, such as uranium, serve as key sources of nuclear energy. In contrast, <strong>light</strong> behaves as the fastest form of entropy propagation. Though massless, even light is <strong>influenced by local entropic curvature</strong>, which explains its bending near massive bodies.</p>
    <p>From this insight, we developed a <strong>33-dimensional model</strong> — not as a replacement for spatial dimensions, nor in search of mathematical perfection, but to describe the <strong>freedoms of entropy propagation</strong>. This model begins at <strong>-1D</strong>, where materials fail to hold structure and decay begins; passes through <strong>0D</strong>, a state of perfect stillness; and culminates at <strong>32D</strong>, where entropy collapses into a black hole. Each dimension adds a new degree of entropic freedom — describing the system’s readiness for structural decay. With this framework, all physical phenomena — from <strong>phase transitions</strong> to <strong>nuclear chain reactions</strong> — are reinterpreted under the logic of entropy-decay.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">3. Hypothesis</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>The central hypothesis of the Entropy-Decay Theory is that all physical behavior — including motion, field propagation, mass, and structure — emerges from entropy-triggered decay processes aligned along independent dimensional channels. Specifically, when an external entropy source (such as light or current) matches a material’s intrinsic decay step frequency (τ-resonance), it can trigger a release of stored entropic memory. This release may cause nonlinear effects, dimensional shifts, or second-cascade transitions not predicted by conventional physics.</p>

    <p>This hypothesis departs from traditional models that assume continuity in spacetime or particle-object ontology. It proposes instead that all transmission (light, signal, current) occurs by resonance-triggered internal replication — not physical passage — meaning nothing "travels through" a medium in the classical sense.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">4. Mathematical Model</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>The mathematical backbone of the theory is a reformation of Tsang’s Equation, integrating both wave and stochastic decay functions as simultaneous entropic operations. This section explores how traditional physics equations are reshaped by eliminating explicit dependence on t (time), and instead express behavior through τ (decay steps) and Ψ (entropy curvature intensity). Dimensional fields (e.g., 12D conductivity, 14D surface resistance) are introduced not as spatial volumes but as entropic constraints.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">5. Experimental Applications</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>While the theory is conceptual, it opens the door to physical experiments — particularly using naturally entropic materials. Geological substances like India Red marble or red granite may contain trapped entropic memory fields that can be released via τ-resonant triggering. This section outlines early experimental proposals, including devices designed to stimulate second entropy cascades in controlled environments, and detect resonance behavior not explainable by electromagnetic models alone.</p>
