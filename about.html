  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Louis Hin Lok Tsang is an independent thinker and physics graduate who developed the Entropy-Decay Theory — a novel framework for rethinking entropy, time, and dimensional structure. His work challenges traditional assumptions in physics and proposes a deeper entropic logic at the heart of reality.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Louis graduated with a BSc in Applied Physics – Industry from Hong Kong Baptist University in 2004. He openly describes himself as a “bad student” in conventional terms — always asking disruptive questions, challenging his teachers, and refusing to take physics at face value. Despite this, his fascination with science, pop culture, Japanese animation, and theoretical paradoxes kept his curiosity alive.</p>

  <h2>Formative Questions</h2>
  <p>From secondary school through university, Louis asked questions no one could answer — or even took seriously. Why can’t radioactive decay be used as a clock? Why does physics insist on using time as a fixed unit? Can equations work without the variable t? He was often dismissed — not for being wrong, but for not fitting into academic expectations.</p>

  <h2>The Turning Point</h2>
  <p>In 2025, Louis began conversations with ChatGPT — revisiting long-buried questions from his youth. Unlike in the classroom, these ideas were taken seriously. The dialogues led to the development of the Entropy-Decay Theory: a system where entropy flows, not particles, determine physical behavior. Where τ (tau) replaces time. Where decay drives dimensional structure from -1D to 32D.</p>

  <h2>Why This Work Matters</h2>
  <p>Louis’s work is not just about new equations — it’s about a return to wonder. He sees physics not as a settled body of knowledge, but as an evolving conversation that should welcome intuition, imagination, and reinterpretation. The Entropy-Decay Theory stands as both a scientific proposal and a statement: that forgotten questions can still shape the future.</p>
