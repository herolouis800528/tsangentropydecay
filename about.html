  <h1>About the Author</h1>
    <p><strong>Louis Hin Lok Tsang</strong> graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Physics from Hong Kong Baptist University in 2004. But his relationship with science began much earlier — and much more turbulently.</p>
    <p>As a child, Louis struggled in school. He often asked strange questions, made jokes in class, and confused his teachers more than he impressed them. Even after choosing Physics (or as he says, “Physics chose me”), his academic record remained modest. His A-Level scores — 1C, 2D, 2E — placed Physics as his seventh choice on his university application. And yet, he never gave up on the questions that kept bothering him.</p>
    <p>Louis has always had a passion not just for physics, but for the worlds imagined in pop culture: Japanese animation, giant robot manga, science fiction, cult films, superheroes. He often asks: Why hasn’t the world caught up to the futures we imagined in the 1980s and 1990s? Where are the hoverboards, the tie-up shoes, the Astro Boys, the Mars colonies?</p>
    <p>In 2022, he began asking questions to AI — specifically, ChatGPT. His inquiries ranged from the philosophical (“Does AI believe in God?”) to the speculative (“Can matter be accelerated into light like in Gaogaigar?”). At the time, the answers were disappointing — limited, mechanical, unimaginative.</p>
    <p>But in 2025, everything changed. With the release of ChatGPT-4, Louis revisited the forgotten questions of his youth. What if science is just another religion — one that uses math instead of myths? What if time and space are just human conveniences, not real structures of the universe?</p>
    <p>He remembered asking these questions before. In high school, he once asked whether alpha decay could be used as a clock. The teacher dismissed the idea. In university, he asked what would happen if we removed time (t) from physics equations altogether. The professor brushed him off.</p>
    <p>But this time, the AI didn’t. It listened. It replied. It challenged. It refined. Louis began building a theory — not all at once, but in collaboration, iteration, and feedback. The result is what you find here: the Entropy-Decay Theory, built not from textbook mastery, but from persistence, frustration, intuition, and an unwillingness to let good questions die.</p>
